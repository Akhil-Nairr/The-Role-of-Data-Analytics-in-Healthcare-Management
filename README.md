# The Role of Data Analytics in Healthcare Management

## Project Overview
This repository contains the research and analysis work for the project "The Role of Data Analytics in Healthcare Management." The aim of this project is to investigate the impact of data analytics on patient care outcomes, healthcare resource allocation, the identification and mitigation of healthcare disparities, and the shift from fee-for-service to value-based care models.

## Objectives
1. To correlate data analytics practices with improved patient care outcomes.
2. To examine the role of data analytics in optimizing healthcare resource allocation.
3. To assess how effectively data analytics can pinpoint and address disparities in healthcare.
4. To evaluate the contributions of data analytics to the advancement of value-based care.

## Results and Findings
The study highlights the various degrees of engagement with big data analytics within healthcare roles, identifying natural language processing (NLP) as a predominant technique for supporting clinical and operational tasks. However, the findings also indicate significant barriers to the adoption of big data analytics, such as limited evidence of tangible benefits, funding challenges, and technological hurdles.

## Specific Outcomes
This project establishes the crucial importance of integrating big data analytics within healthcare frameworks and presents key challenges and potential pathways for its implementation in healthcare settings.

## Learnings
